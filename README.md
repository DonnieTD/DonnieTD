<!-- # 👋 Hey, I’m Donnie (DonnieTD) -->

I build **systems**, not demos — and I care a lot about what’s left behind _after_ code runs.

This repo (and my profile) is a collection of projects where execution is **explicit**, state is **inspectable**, and nothing important is hidden behind “magic”.

Think less _framework glue_, more _clear machinery_.

---

## 🧠 What I Care About

- 🧩 **Structure before optimization**
- 📜 **Artifacts over logs**
- 🔁 **Replayable execution**
- 🕰 **History you can inspect**
- 🔒 **Invariants that don’t lie**

If a system can’t explain itself after the fact, I don’t trust it yet.

## 🔭 What I’m Exploring Right Now

- Artifact-based execution models
- ML systems you can replay and audit
- Compiler pipelines with explicit semantics
- Low-level systems with high-level guarantees

---

## 🧑‍💻 Final Thoughts

Nothing here is meant to be flashy.
It’s meant to **hold up over time**.

If you like:

- compilers 🧵
- execution models ⏱
- machine learning without mysticism 🧠
- systems that don’t hide their mistakes 🔍

…you’ll probably enjoy poking around.
